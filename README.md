# Daily Planner App Readme

## User Story

As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to have a convenient daily planner to add and manage important events. This will allow me to organize my time effectively and improve productivity.

## Acceptance Criteria

The Daily Planner app should:

1. **Display Current Day:**
   - When a user opens the planner, the current day should be prominently displayed at the top of the calendar.

2. **Present Timeblocks:**
   - Timeblocks for standard business hours should be presented to the user as they scroll down the planner.

3. **Color-coded Timeblocks:**
   - Each timeblock should be color-coded based on whether it represents the past, present, or future when viewed.
     - Past timeblocks: Different color to indicate they have already occurred.
     - Present timeblock: Highlighted with a distinct color to signify the current time.
     - Future timeblocks: A separate color to suggest upcoming events.

4. **Event Entry:**
   - A user should be able to click on a timeblock to enter an event for that specific time.

5. **Save Event to Local Storage:**
   - When the user clicks the save button within a timeblock, the entered event should be saved in the local storage.

6. **Persistence between Refreshes:**
   - Events entered into the planner should persist between page refreshes. This ensures that the user's schedule is retained and can be easily accessed even after a page reload.

## How to Use
